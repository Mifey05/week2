let's make it clear, i don't get a single bit of the flowchart structure at all. I also just send the flowchart picture to Gemini (since that's the only AI i can send pictures to on my phone) and let it entirely turn the flowchart into dart. The problem with what i did is that i send the code entirely to all 4 of my group members. the latest version which i sent over, i'm not sure if the last fella updated it in time before the time ran out. Gemini itself had very few troubles with the flowchart. it created its own list of words and added an extra feature to guess the entire word on the cost of 2 lives which is not part of the original flowchart.
in summary, i'm afraid i didn't live up to the goal of the challenge (which, as far as i can get is about seeing if the other member had actually read the effective dart guideline which would translate to if i can read and easily understand the code written by the previous fella), partly due to me not understanding a single shit about the flowchart, me glossing over the guideline instead of fully reading it, and me not being ready to write a whole dart program (i don't even know how to create an array in dart).
i will accept any form of punishment that could arise from this, as long as the other 4 member doesn't suffer the consequences. i'm sure you'll quickly find who those 4 are from the similarity of the code.
